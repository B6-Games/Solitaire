# ♦️ FreeCell Solitaire: Overview, History, and Rules

## Overview

**FreeCell Solitaire** is one of the most strategic and skill-based solitaire card games ever created.  
Unlike many other solitaire variants that rely heavily on luck, **nearly every FreeCell deal can be solved** with enough foresight and planning.

The game uses **a single standard 52-card deck**, and all cards are dealt face up at the start - allowing players to see every card and plan their moves in advance.  
The objective is to build all four foundation piles, one for each suit, in ascending order from **Ace to King**.

## History

FreeCell traces its roots back to the 1960s, when it was known as a variation of older patience games such as *Eight Off* and *Baker’s Game*.  
It was first computerized by **Paul Alfille** in **1978** for the PLATO computer system, where it gained early popularity among students and programmers.

The game reached worldwide fame when **Microsoft** included it in **Windows 95** and later systems, making it a household name.  
Its unique blend of logic and transparency - every card visible from the start - made it stand out from luck-based games like Klondike.

Today, FreeCell remains a favorite among players who enjoy games of pure skill, strategy, and planning.

## Rules of FreeCell Solitaire

### 🃏 Objective
Move all cards to the **four foundation piles**, arranged by suit in ascending order from **Ace to King**.

---

### 🎴 Setup
- Played with **one standard 52-card deck**.
- All cards are dealt face up into **eight tableau columns**:
  - The first four columns have **7 cards** each.
  - The last four columns have **6 cards** each.
- There are **four FreeCells** (temporary holding spaces) and **four Foundation piles**.

---

### 🔁 Gameplay
1. **Move Cards:**  
   You can move the top card of any tableau column to another column, a FreeCell, or a foundation pile.
2. **Build Tableau Columns:**  
   Cards are built in descending order and **alternating colors** (e.g., red 7 on black 8).
3. **Use FreeCells:**  
   Each FreeCell can hold one card temporarily - freeing space for maneuvering.
4. **Empty Columns:**  
   Any card (or a sequence starting with a King) can be moved to an empty tableau column.
5. **Build Foundations:**  
   Start each foundation with an Ace and build upward in suit to the King.

---

### ♻️ Mobility Rule
The number of cards you can move at once depends on how many **FreeCells and empty tableau columns** are available:  
Max movable cards = (number of empty FreeCells + 1) × (2 ^ number of empty columns)
This mechanic adds deep strategy - managing FreeCells wisely is key to winning.

---

### 🧠 Winning the Game
The game is won when all cards are placed into the foundation piles in correct suit order.  
Most deals are **solvable** with perfect play, though a few (like deal #11982 in Microsoft’s version) are famously unsolvable.

---

## Strategy Tips
- **Free up Aces early.** Get Aces to the foundations as soon as possible.
- **Keep FreeCells open.** Use them temporarily, not permanently - open cells give flexibility.
- **Plan several moves ahead.** Since all cards are visible, look for long-term sequences.
- **Create empty columns.** Empty columns act as powerful temporary spaces.
- **Undo wisely.** Digital versions allow undo - use it to experiment with strategy.

---

## Fun Fact 💡
Only **one standard FreeCell deal** (number 11982 in Microsoft’s original version) is unsolvable - out of over **32,000** classic deals!
