## 🧠 Strategy Tips for Forty Thieves Solitaire

- **Focus on freeing columns early.** Open spaces are crucial for maneuvering cards.  
- **Play Aces and low cards quickly.** They unlock foundation progress and free up the tableau.  
- **Avoid blocking key cards.** Moving cards too early can block sequences later on.  
- **Keep suits aligned.** You can only build within the same suit - mixing suits limits your options.  
- **Use the waste pile carefully.** Always check if a card can be moved to a foundation before covering it with a new draw.

## Variations

- **Little Forty Thieves:** A simplified version with fewer tableau columns.  
- **Double Klondike:** Also uses two decks but allows more flexible building rules.  
- **Streets and Alleys:** Similar layout but all cards are visible from the start.  
- **Forty and Eight:** Allows building regardless of suit, making it easier for beginners.
