## History

Simple Simon likely emerged in the **mid-20th century** as a modern, simplified take on Spider-style games: same “build-down” feel, but **no stock pile** and **total information** from move one.  
It found a wider audience once included in **PC and mobile solitaire collections**, where players appreciated its quick setup and logic-heavy gameplay.

## Rules of Simple Simon Solitaire

### 🃏 Objective
Build **four complete sequences** in the same suit, each from **K → Q → J → … → A**.  
When a full in-suit run (K to A) is formed, it is **removed**. Clear all four suits to win.

---

### 🎴 Setup
- Use **one 52-card deck**.
- Deal **all cards face up** into **10 tableau columns** (distributions vary by implementation; the deck is divided as evenly as possible across the columns).
- There are **no foundations and no stock/waste piles** - everything happens on the tableau.

> **Key takeaway:** Because every card is visible, Simple Simon rewards planning rather than luck.

### 🔁 Gameplay

1. **Build Down by Rank (Any Suit to Place)**  
   - You may place a card onto another card that is **exactly one rank higher**, **regardless of suit**  
     (e.g., ♦7 may go on ♠8).

2. **Move Packed Sequences (In-Suit Only)**  
   - You can move a **contiguous descending sequence** **only if all cards in that sequence are the same suit**  
     (e.g., ♥10–♥9–♥8 can move as a block; ♥10–♣9 cannot).

3. **Empty Columns**  
   - **Any single card or any in-suit sequence** may be moved to an empty column (use empties as powerful temporary parking).

4. **Complete & Remove Runs**  
   - When you finish a full **K→A** sequence **in one suit**, remove it from play.  
   - Keep assembling and clearing until all four suit runs are gone.

### 🏆 Winning the Game
You win by **removing all four complete K-to-A suit sequences**.  
With no stock and full visibility, losses usually come from **locking sequences** or **mismanaging empty columns** - not bad luck.

## 🧠 Strategy Tips for Simple Simon

- **Prioritize in-suit ordering.** Mixing suits creates “broken” stacks that can’t move together later.  
- **Create (and protect) empty columns.** Empties are the engine for deep rearrangements; don’t fill them frivolously.  
- **Unwind from the top.** Free higher ranks first to expose spaces for longer, in-suit packs.  
- **Stage before you stack.** Sometimes place a card “temporarily wrong” to open space, then re-form an in-suit pack.  
- **Don’t rush to complete a run** if it blocks progress; sometimes waiting lets you consolidate more efficiently.

---

## Variations

- **Relaxed Simple Simon:** Allows moving mixed-suit packs as a unit (much easier).  
- **Hard Mode:** Restricts what can enter an empty column (e.g., only Kings or sequences starting with King).  
- **Two-Suit/One-Suit Themes:** Cosmetic variants used in some apps to aid readability.
