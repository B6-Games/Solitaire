# 8️⃣ Eight Off Solitaire: Rules, History, and How to Play Online

## Overview

**Eight Off Solitaire** is a strategic, skill-forward cousin of **FreeCell** and **Baker’s Game**.  
Played with **one standard 52-card deck**, it features **eight reserve cells** (“eight off”) that you use to park cards while you organize the tableau.  
The objective is to build the **four foundation piles** by suit from **Ace to King**.

Compared with FreeCell, Eight Off is **more orderly** (you build the tableau **down by suit**, not alternating colors) and slightly tougher-making it perfect for players who like logic, planning, and clean suit stacks.  
You can **play Eight Off Solitaire online for free** on desktop or mobile-no download required.

## History

Eight Off descends from classic patience games popularized in the **mid-20th century**, closely related to **Baker’s Game** (a known ancestor of FreeCell).  
Its hallmark is the **larger reserve area** (eight cells vs. FreeCell’s four), with some cells often **pre-filled at the start**, shifting early-game tactics toward careful space management.  
The game spread widely through **PC collections and mobile apps**, where its “all-skill, low-luck” feel won over puzzle-minded players.

## Rules of Eight Off Solitaire

---

### 🎴 Setup
- Use **one 52-card deck**.
- Deal the **tableau** into **eight columns**:
  - **6 cards** per column **face up** (total 48 cards).
- Place the remaining **4 cards** face up into **four of the eight reserve cells** (the other **4 cells start empty**).

### 🔁 Gameplay

1. **Tableau Building (By Suit)**
   - Build **down in rank and same suit** (e.g., ♠8 on ♠9).
   - You may move a **single card** or a **properly ordered in-suit sequence** if your empty cells/columns allow it (see Mobility).

2. **Reserve Cells (“Eight Off”)**
   - Each cell holds **one card**.
   - Use cells as **temporary storage** to free and realign tableau cards.
   - Try to keep some cells **open**; empty cells are your mobility engine.

3. **Empty Columns**
   - Only a **King** (or a **sequence starting with a King**) may be moved into an empty tableau column.

4. **Foundations**
   - Move **Aces** to foundations when available, then build up by suit to **King**.
