## Rules of Scorpion Solitaire

### 🃏 Objective

The goal of Scorpion Solitaire is to build **four complete sequences**, each from **King down to Ace** in the same suit.  
Once a sequence is complete, it’s removed from the tableau. You win when all four suits are completed.

---

### 🎴 Setup

- Played with **one standard 52-card deck**.  
- Deal **49 cards** face up into **7 tableau columns**:
  - The first four columns each get **7 cards**, with the **top three cards face down**.  
  - The last three columns each get **7 cards**, all **face up**.  
- The remaining **3 cards** are placed aside as the **stock pile**, face down.

Only the top cards of the tableau piles are playable at first; as face-down cards are uncovered, they become available.

---

### 🔁 Gameplay

1. **Build in Descending Order (Same Suit)**  
   - Cards can be placed on another card if it is **one rank higher** and of the **same suit**.  
   - Example: You can place the ♦️6 on top of ♦️7.

2. **Move Sequences**  
   - You can move entire in-suit sequences together as a unit (e.g., ♠️10–♠️9–♠️8).

3. **Empty Columns**  
   - Only a **King** (or a sequence starting with a King) can be moved into an empty column.

4. **Uncover Hidden Cards**  
   - When a face-down card is uncovered, it’s immediately turned face up.

5. **Deal the Stock**  
   - After you’ve played all possible moves, deal the remaining **3 stock cards** - one onto each of the first three tableau columns.

### 🏆 Winning the Game

You win when all cards are arranged into **four descending King-to-Ace sequences** of the same suit.  
These sequences are usually automatically removed or visually separated when complete.

If you reach a state where no moves are possible, the game ends - though careful planning can prevent deadlocks.

---

## Strategy Tips

- **Expose face-down cards early.** The faster you uncover hidden cards, the more flexible your moves become.  
- **Focus on suit continuity.** Only same-suit sequences can move together; avoid mixing suits unless necessary.  
- **Keep columns open.** Empty spaces are extremely valuable for moving Kings or long sequences.  
- **Plan before dealing stock cards.** Once dealt, the stock cards can block columns if not used wisely.  
- **Don’t rush to move Kings.** Only move them when it strategically helps free up new plays.

---

## Variations

- **Easy Scorpion:** Uses fewer face-down cards or allows building regardless of suit.  
- **Simple Simon:** A close variant where all cards start face up, making it more about logic than luck.  
- **Spider Solitaire:** A related game played with two decks and more complex movement rules.

---

## Fun Fact 💡

Despite its difficulty, many experienced players prefer Scorpion over Spider because **all cards are in play from the start**, creating a perfect balance between luck and logic.
